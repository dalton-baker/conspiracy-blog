                Welcome to <strong>Dalton’s Department of Truth</strong>, where the veil of deception is torn
                asunder and the blinding light of reality shines unfiltered. This is not your grandma’s blog,
                this is the last bastion of sanity in a world powered by lies, lizards, and greys from another
                galaxy.
            </p>

            <p>
                I’m Dalton, truth excavator, myth destroyer, and part-time software enthusiast. While the world
                scrolls aimlessly through cat videos and government-approved narratives, I’m busy <em>connecting
                    the dots</em> they told you didn’t exist. From lunar landlord conspiracies to the corporate
                cabals shaping our breakfast cereal choices, no stone is left unturned and no truth left
                comfortably hidden.

                The Department’s mission is simple: <strong>wake people up</strong> before the algorithm tucks
                them back in. Every article, every revelation, every deranged headline you’ll find here has one
                goal; to remind you that the world isn't waht it seems.
            </p>

            <p class="fst-italic text-warning">
                Open your eyes. Question everything. Especially this website.

                If you’ve made it this far, congratulations, you’re already more awake than 90% of your peers.
                Stay curious, stay skeptical, and if the Department vanishes overnight… you’ll know we got too
                close to the truth.
