                </h2>

    <div class="container mb-5">
        <article class="container py-4" <p><em>For decades, they told us the Moon was lifeless rock, a barren satellite,
                nothing more than a nightlight for Earth. But that’s the cover story. The truth is the Moon is owned
                real estate, a gated community in the sky reserved for the same old bloodlines and banking families
                who’ve owned everything else since time began.</em></p>

            <h5 class="mt-4">Follow the Paper Trail</h5>
            <p>Ever wonder why every space mission, from Apollo to Artemis, stops at the same handful of coordinates?
                That isn’t random. It’s zoning. Lunar zoning. NASA doesn’t explore; they inspect the property lines. The
                “dark side” of the Moon isn’t about sunlight, it’s about secrecy. You don’t get to see the gated
                sections where the tenants live.</p>
            <h5 class="mt-4">Who Are the Tenants?</h5>
            <p>The so-called “greys.” The elite rent out lunar bunkers to them as a tax haven. The aliens don’t use
                cash, they pay rent in encrypted crypto through quantum relay networks. But here’s the kicker: Earth
                didn’t even have the tech to process their payments until after the Roswell incident. Notice how
                computers suddenly got faster, smaller, and more connected right after that? It wasn’t innovation, it
                was infrastructure. The elites were upgrading human tech so the planet could handle the incoming lunar
                rent payments. Every leap in computing power since then has been about one thing — making sure the alien
                tenants can pay on time.</p>
            <h5 class="mt-4">The Cryptocurrency Connection</h5>
            <p>Now it starts to make sense. Why the obsession with crypto? Because alien tenants don’t use fiat
                currency. Crypto isn’t for us — it’s the rent payment system. Completely off-planet, untraceable, and
                decentralized so no Earthly government can regulate it. The elites are laundering interplanetary rent
                money, hiding their cosmic Airbnb profits behind the illusion of blockchain freedom.</p>

            <p>You thought “To the Moon” was just a meme? Think again. It was always literal.</p>
